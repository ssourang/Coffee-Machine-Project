# Coffee-Machine-Project
It is very easy to run out of energy after hours of working on a particular project, playing games … When that happens, we might want to take some rest before resuming our work, or whatever we were doing. But what if we have a deadline to meet and that we are short on time? In that case, some coffee could give us just about the energy we need to keep us going. That’s exactly what we will model here. The latter will be based on hot flavors (Cappuccino, Espresso, Latte) that a customer can choose from, a resource management system, a coin’s operation system (coins’ processing, successful transaction), and an automatic cup dispenser. This small project allowed me to have a deep grasp of the OOP foundations and appreciate how breaking down a problem into blueprints makes the code more organised and more importantly, more maintainable.
